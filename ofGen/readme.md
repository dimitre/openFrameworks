# ofGen

meant to work as projectGenerator

## Thoughts
- we now have platforms (operational systems?) (windows, linux)
- we have targets (ios, macos, android etc.)
- we have IDEs tied to platforms (xcode, visual studio)
- and IDEs attending multiple platforms/targets (VSCode, ZED)
- and build systems (Make) attending multiple platforms/targets
